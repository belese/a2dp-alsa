=========

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of a2dp-alsa using bluez DBus API.
It acts as a bluetooth "source", accepts input on stdin to be sent to external bluetooth speaker.
It acts as a bluetooth "sink", outputs on raw sound on stdout which you can pipe to aplay.

The code lives in a2dp-alsa.c (single file, not refactored yet).

Externals:
---
a2dp-codecs.h is from bluez 4.101
ipc.h is from bluez 4.101
rtp.h is from bluez 4.101
sbc.* is from bluez 4.101
uthash.h is from http://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/
What else you need to compile: dbus, and of course bluez bluetoothd to run it.

How to use
==========

As it is configured today, the stdout output is S16_LE, 44.1 kHz, either stereo or mono
(depending on what the source supports). You can pipe the output to "aplay -f cd" and it should work.

The stdin input is expected to be S16_LE, 44.1 kHz too, either stereo or mono, 
depending on what the sink support.

Only SBC codec is supported at the moment.

To tell a2dp-alsa as a sink (device streams audio to computer running a2dp):
- edit /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf and add "source" to "Enable" under [General]
- remove "Socket" under "Enable" under [General]
- run "a2dp-alsa --sink | aplay -f cd" (we pipe a2dp's output to aplay, which will output it to computer's speaker)
- connect your device (many ways of doing it, at the basic level you can do
  dbus-send --system --dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/[bluetoothd-pid]/hci/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX org.bluez.AudioSource.Connect
  (where XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX is the device's bluetooth address).

To tell a2dp-alsa as a source (streams audio from computer to bluetooth speaker)
- remove "Socket" under "Enable" under [General]
- run "audio-source --source | a2dp-alsa --source" where audio-source is a program that will produce raw audio data on stdout,
  example: "mpg321 --stdout xxx.mp3", or "ffmpeg -i xxx.mp3 -", etc.
- connect your bluetooth speaker, e.g:
  dbus-send --system --dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/[bluetoothd-pid]/hci/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX org.bluez.AudioSink.Connect
  (where XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX is the device's bluetooth address).

Two mode of operation for "source":
1. Running as --run-once will tell a2dp-alsa to quit as soon as stdin is exhausted, it only has effects with --source.
This is probably what you want if you use it inside asoundrc (bearing in mind that 
as soon as a2dp-alsa quits, the bluetooth connection is terminated and you will have to re-connect again next time).
This has the effect of running a2dp-alsa "on-demand".
ffmpeg works with this, VLC stutters, youtube crash.

---
pcm.a2dp {
	type file
	slave.pcm "null"
	file "| a2dp-alsa --source --run-once"
}
---

2. Or you can run a permanent "a2dp server". Useful if you want to run this together with --sink too.
First, make a fifo (say mkfifo /tmp/a2dp.fifo), 
then "a2dp-buffer /tmp/a2dp.fifo | a2dp-alsa --source" 
Use this asoundrc.
Run this way, ffmpeg (still) works, VLC works (output to file, set to the fifo), youtube still crash.
---
pcm.a2dpfifo {
	type file
	slave.pcm "null"
	file "/tmp/a2dp.fifo"
}
---

There is a small utility a2dp-buffer whose job is is to read a pipe and put what
it has read to stdout. If the pipe is closed, it will re-open again, forever.
It also tries to buffer the content.

With a2dp-buffer it is possible to run a2dp-alsa as a "A2DP soundserver" accepting
providing sink and source at the same time, like this:
"a2dp-buffer /tmp/a2dp.fifo | a2dp-alsa --source --sink | aplay -f cd" 
(after you have made the fifo). Use the second asoundrc above for settings.

How it works
============
1. Media.RegisterEndpoint (UUID as A2DP Sink or Source)

2. When somebody attempt connection / streaming, bluez will:
   - call MediaEndpoint.SelectConfiguration, then
   - call MediaEndpoint.SetConfiguration
     == during SetConfiguration, store the given transport_path
        (in our case, we also create I/O thread, but leave it as idle)
     
3. Then bluez will issue AudioSource (or AudioSink) PropertyChange
   when stream is connected.
   
   For AudioSource (bt sink: bt --> alsa),
   we find the transition from "connected" to "playing" and then we call MediaTransport.Acquire 
   (using the saved transport_path) to get the descriptors, then we tell our thread to start
   streaming.
   If the transition is "playing" --> "connected", we stop streaming and release transport.
   
   For AudioSink (bt source: alsa --> bt),
   we are in charge of the transmission. Only when we acquire the state will change to "playing"
   so we can't wait for it. Instead, we wait for transition from "disconnected" to "connected" and
   then we acquire the transport. 
   We stop streaming and release the transport if we detect "connected" --> "disconnected" transition.
   
   Note: In bluez 5, AudioSource/Sink PropertyChange will be replaced by org.freedesktop.Properties.PropertyChanged.
   for arg=org.bluez.MediaTransport1.
   
   bluez also have TryAcquire which only makes sense for "bt source" above - if the device is not already connected,
   it will not connect. Acquire will *always* make a connection when possible.
   
4. During streaming:   
   Read/write the fd as required.
   Data format is RTP --> RTP header + RTP payload.
   RTP payload depends on codec, for SBC it is SBC-header + SBC frame(s).
   
5. When one of the party disconnects, bluez will issue:
   - MediaEndpoint.ClearConfiguration
     == stop streaming from here onwards, immediate
        (kill our I/O thread).
        
6. MediaEndpoint.Release will be called when bluez wants us to shutdown.
   Do our own cleanup, no need to de-register etc.
   (stop all I/O threads, then quit)

That's it! The process is the same for either Sink or Source.


TODO:
======

1. It can act as sink and/or source.
   But using it both as sink/source at the same time, somehow causes output
   streaming (from computer to bluetooth speaker) to stutter - need to investigate.
   
2. Minimal error checking (purpose is to show how it works).

3. Will work with multiple bt devices connected but look - there is only one input
   (stdin) and output (stdout). You can make it work as a simple router 
   (bt phone --> (sink) computer (source) --> bt speaker) by piping
   sink's output to source's fifo, like this:
   
   "a2dp-buffer /tmp/a2dp.fifo | a2dp-alsa --source --sink | aplay -f cd -D a2dpfifo"
   
   but because of problem no. 1 above, streaming is not very smooth.
   
4. Now only works on bluez 4.x (4.101 tested), may need to refactor to work on bluez 5.
   The biggest stud: the org.bluez.AudioSource / org.bluez.AudioSink signals are gone so 
   we need another way to know when we can Acquire the transport, supposedly as noted above.

What can be improved:
- check why running both input and output causes output to stutter.
- handle device changes - auto-detect new devices and auto-shutdown on removal.
- merge a2dp-buffer with bt_write
- make an alsa-library driver for it (like pcm_bluetooth, which is removed in bluez 5),
  instead of the kludge with alsa 'file' plugin as above.
- make it bluez 5 capable. Note that at this time of writing, June 2013, bluez has been 
  on the wild for 6 months, the API keeps changing, and even pulseaudio - the biggest
  supporter of bluez, still hasn't supported bluez 5.
- etc.
